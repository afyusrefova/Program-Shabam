    <h3>The question library on air related issues</h3>
		
    <p class="p-title">Can we retreat energy form air?</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
            It is possible to retreat energy from air. We have been using air as an energy supplier for thousands of years. For this application of air, wind is an important factor. Wind can aid the motions of wind turbines, so that wind energy can be generated.
    </p>
	
    <p class="p-title">What is wind energy?</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
            Previously, we used windmills to pump water from one place to another and to grind grain to flour. Today large wind turbines are applied for the generation of energy for electricity production. These windmills work according to the same principle as a dynamo; when they are in motion, energy is converted to electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
            Wind energy is what we call 'sustainable energy', just like solar energy and waterpower. It is called sustainable because we do not burn fossil fuels for the collection of the energy, so that no harmful pollutants will end up in air. Also, we do not use any non-renewable resources for the generation of wind energy. Wind is a renewable energy resource.	
    </p>
    <p>
            Ever since the 1980's the applications of wind turbines for electricity production has increased. As we speak, wind turbines are responsible for the production of 1% of the world's electricity. In several countries, such as Holland, the government is placing wind turbines on farmland. Plans have been made to place a wind turbine park in the North Sea.
            Wind energy knows no limits. In principle, by placing wind turbines we can produce enough energy to sustain a country.
    </p>
	
    <p class="p-title">How does a wind turbine work?</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
            Wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the blades of the wind turbine, spinning a shaft. The shaft is connected to a generator, which generates electricity.
            Industrial scale turbines range in size from 50 to 750 kilowatts. Single, small turbines, below 50 kilowatts, are used for homes, telecommunications dishes, or water pumping. The electricity is sent to these receptors through transmission and distribution lines.
    </p>
	
    <p class="p-title">What types of wind turbines are there?</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
            There are two types of wind turbines. The first type is the three-bladed wind turbine, which is operated "upwind", with the blades facing into the wind. The other wind turbine type is the two-bladed, "downwind" turbine.
    </p>
	
    <p class="p-title">Are there any drawbacks to wind energy?</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
            Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks to wind energy, mainly due to the presence of wind turbines:<br>
            - Wind turbines produce quite an amount of noise, so that sound nuisance can become a problem for inhabitants of areas with wind turbines.<br>
            - Birds can become injured or die when they end up in the wings of a wind turbine. (However, it has been calculated that there is a much bigger chance of a bird being driven over by a car.)<br>
            - Wind turbines are quite visible, because of their height. This can cause so-called horizon pollution.<br>
            - When there is no wind we need an alternative energy source, because wind turbines cannot produce electricity when it is windless.
